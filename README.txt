The game I have made is a version of flappy bird. 
The controls are up/down/left/right arrows to move the bird. To win you have to reach the end (the green rectangle on the right) without hitting the tubes in the given amount of time.

You can reset the game at any time by pressing the SELECT button. 

The game has animation on the main title screen (the bird moving)
And has dynamic messages at the end of the win/loose screen.
